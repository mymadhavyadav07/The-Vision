Use it if you are lazy :)

# Idea
The idea behind Vision is simple. You can simply create a telegram bot and use it for OSINT and information gathering purposes.

# Installation
  Step-1: Grab some patience you might need it during the process of installation lol.  
  
  Step-2: Go to telegram bot-father (https://telegram.me/BotFather) and ask him to create a new bot.  
  
  Step-3: Copy the api-token of your bot.  
  
  Step-4: Paste it in place of **<BOT-API-TOKEN>** in **main.py** file (warning - don't remove the inverted commas).   
  
  Step-5: Enter your instagram username and password in **Osintgram/config/credentials.ini** file.  

  Step-6: Now run **main.py** file, go to the bot you have created and type **/help** (main.py should keep running while you are using the telegram bot).
        Now, here comes the use of a server. You may buy a cloud server but, in case you don't want to spend money you may use **termux** which can keep this
        script running in background until your phone is not switched off. Another cheaper way is you can use a **raspberyy pi** for keeping this script running.  
        
  Step-7: I am done with the explaination go and enjoy!!👍  

# Installation
I don't think you would require a usage guide...Vision is user-friendly(at least I think so) 😀
But, in case you need a usage guide...raise an issue 👍
