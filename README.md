  # The Vision
  This is a simple telegram bot which can be used for running popular open-source tools realted to OSINT/Hacking 
  
  # Idea
  This telegram bot script is hosted on cloud using streamlit cloud service and can be accessed through a telegram bot on your fingertips.


<!--# Installation
  Step-1: Grab some patience you might need it during the process of installation lol.  
  
  Step-2: Go to telegram bot-father (https://telegram.me/BotFather) and ask him to create a new bot.  
  
  Step-3: Copy the api-token of your bot.  
  
  Step-4: Paste it in place of **<BOT-API-TOKEN>** in **main.py** file (warning - don't remove the inverted commas).   
  
  Step-5: Enter your instagram username and password in **Osintgram/config/credentials.ini** file.  
  
  Step-6: Run ```pip install -r requirements.txt```.
  
  Step-7: Now run **main.py** file, go to the bot you have created and type **/help** (main.py should keep running while you are using the telegram bot).
        Now, here comes the use of a server. You may buy a cloud server but, in case you don't want to spend money you may use **termux** which can keep this
        script running in background until your phone is not switched off. Another cheaper way is you can use a **raspberyy pi** for keeping this script running.  
        
  Step-8: I am done with the explaination go and enjoy!!👍
